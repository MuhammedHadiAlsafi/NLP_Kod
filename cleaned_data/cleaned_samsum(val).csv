"#Person1#: Geez, Mayweather totally destroyed McGregor! Did you watch gentlemen??
#Person2#: I'm not very much into boxing, rather prefer MMA but the buzz about this fight made me watch it
#Person2#: And yeah, the black guy seemed to be only defending himself for a few rounds but at the same time Conor lost much of his stamina
#Person3#: Whatta hell are you two talking about??
#Person3#: McGregor and boxing?? He's an mma warrior, those R 2 different worlds! Wtf
#Person3#: And Mayweather?? He's fuckin 40, he's to fuckin old to fight!

#Person3#: But anyway... Mayweather won, you've said that. And McGregor? Was he sharp?
#Person1#: He was, actually I was surprised cause he was fighting pretty well for 5 maybe 6 rounds
#Person1#: Floyd had to keep his guard up and seemed to have little chances cuz the Irishman was attacking again an again
#Person1#: But you know, Floyd is an old bird and all this time he was waiting for Conor to get tired and you know the rest[HAPPY]
#Person3#: Experience bitch, he beat 'The Notorious' thanks to his fuckin experience!
#Person1#: No doubt about it, bro
#Person2#: But you know, Mcgregor's never fought 10 rounds, in MMA 3 rounds is the limit

#Person3#: You've always loved cleaning, haven't you? I remember how angry you used to get with your brother for leaving a mess in the kitchen.
#Person4#: Yeah, she'd always yell at me, even though I was the one in charge when our parents were away.
#Person1#: I don't get why it matters so much whether I clean my flat once a week or once a month. No one died from a bit of dust.
#Person2#: Remind me to never stay at your place:P
#Person3#: I'm somewhere in between. My house is always a mess, but I hate it when it's dirty.
#Person4#: What's the difference?
#Person3#: I can't stand when there's dust, crumbs on the floor etc., so I clean regularly. But I love it when all my stuff just lies around. When I put everything back on shelves or into cabinets, I keep on getting mad that I have to look for it, get up and take it out, and generally lose so much time.

#Person3#: But are you serious or just mad at us?
#Person2#: No, I'm serious. I like your kids. And they're nice enough that if I ask them to do something, they actually do it[LAUGH]
#Person3#: LOL, okay. Actually, I think that when I tell them to go and help aunt Meg with cleaning, they'll think it's fun.
#Person4#: And when you tell them to clean their own rooms, they say you're a monster?[LAUGH]
#Person3#: Exactly. But Bill for example always cleans the windows at my parents house. They don't even need to ask anymore, he simply knows it's his job.
#Person1#: Do they pay him?:P
#Person3#: Well, sometimes. But still I think he likes doing it. I don't know, maybe it's because no one checks if he did it well, he's just left alone to do his thing, so he feels like a man in the house in a way?
#Person2#: Tell them I can pay with cookies if they help me.
#Person3#: The famous chocolate cookies?

#Person1#: found two things we were doing wrong today
#Person2#: maybe it shows that you should keep reading them

#Person1#: first the basic follow-up only gives you temp influence and not the permanent one (so my whole strategy for the day was basically based on a wrong rule:P)
#Person1#: and second, you only get the income for the resources you own (tokens on top) and not for everything you have access to
#Person2#: the map had full symbol drawn for the action so I also thought it was permanent influence
#Person2#: had no idea about the second one
#Person3#: the second rule means money would be much more sparse
#Person1#: well yes but it gives you a reason to build an already existing building again
#Person1#: with the rules we played with there was no sense in doing that
#Person3#: true
#Person3#: yet another game we need to play again with the right rules[WINK]
#Person1#: additionally during the vote phase, if there is a draw the first decision is taken by the player with the least amount of points and not the closest to the player initiating the vote
#Person2#: makes sense
#Person2#: but I'm not sure about the income phase, it's written that you get income for import
#Person4#: well yes but technically the import action is building your own buildings
#Person1#: so no matter how you look at it with import you'll always be on top with your token and get the income
#Person2#: right
#Person2#: well just like Emily said we need to play this again
#Person3#: we can always do it during the next meeting
#Person1#: as usual I'm up for anything

#Person1#: Well, hope so. Just chilling out with a bit of Apprentice on IPlayer.
#Person2#: Haven't watched it this year, what are the idiots up to?
#Person1#: Ooh, it's excellent this time, lots of bitching, backstabbing and foolish choices, cringy puns too!
#Person2#: Sounds great, might look it up for a laugh!
#Person1#: Yeah, good idea! I mean, why did they think that Jetpop would be a good name for an airline, complete with exploding icon for the O in Pop!
#Person2#: They never did! I bet they lost!
#Person1#: Yes, they did indeed! Then there was the one when they decided that Siracha hot sauce was a good idea on top of doughnuts!
#Person2#: Oh my God, I've got to see that, it sounds bloody terrible!

"#Person1#: so how's the new affair going?[WINK]
#Person2#: hmm
#Person1#: what happened?
#Person2#: I'm not sure. I mean everything is fine but there's no chemistry. Maybe there's something wrong with me
#Person1#: There's nothing wrong with you. Don't let yourself think that. Maybe you just need more time
#Person2#: It's not like I wanna give up but sometimes I wonder if I should be forcing myself
#Person1#: Definitely not. But maybe try not to put so much pressure on it
#Person2#: I just don't understand it. And myself
#Person1#: You don't have to understand anything[HAPPY]
#Person2#: I mean there was definitely a spark at the beginning and now I really don't know what happened and how to get it back
#Person1#: You probably started thinking too much[WINK]
#Person2#: Hahah probably. My head is my worst enemy
#Person1#: You just met, don't force it. Why would you want chemistry that just dies out after 3 months? Maybe deep down you're looking for something more serious or stable and that's why you actually don't wanna rush it? And you're older now. It's more difficult to fall madly in love when you are not so easily fooled anymore[WINK]
#Person2#: I get it. It's not even about falling in love. I just don't get what happened. I mean I can't be in a relationship with absolutely no chemistry at all
#Person1#: Well it went away so maybe it will come back[LAUGH] You can't overthink those things. They don't like it[WINK]
#Person2#: I probably am overthinking. We had a heart to heart and I feel much better after the talk
#Person1#: You want soulmates, intellectual connection, and chemistry - that's some high expectations for a new relation. Not everything at once
#Person2#: Yeah I would but I know I can't have it all
#Person1#: Of course you can. But some things work better overtime. On the other hand, do NOT force yourself into anything.
#Person2#: I'm not going to. I guess I've been lucky I found someone who is understanding and wants to discuss things
#Person1#: Exactly. And once you feel safer, chemistry might come back, because you won't be analyzing and thinking and worrying and pressuring yourself[WINK]
#Person2#: You're probably right.",#Person2# doesn't feel the chemistry in her new relationship anymore. #Person1# suggests that #Person2# is overthinking the situation and that #Person2# should give the relationship some time.
"#Person1#: can i ask you something?
#Person2#: ask
#Person1#: i'm going out with Marco and his friends
#Person1#: we will be in a club
#Person1#: and i need a make up inspiration
#Person2#: what will you wear?
#Person1#: black dress
#Person2#: so maybe classic smoky?
#Person1#: boring
#Person2#: smoky with colour accent?
#Person1#: i was thinking about half cut crease
#Person2#: hmm, maybe
#Person2#: have you done any before?
#Person1#: no..
#Person2#: so maybe something easier? you don't want to screw anything, right?
#Person1#: you're right
#Person2#: so maybe spotlight?
#Person2#: just blend a few shades of brown and put some metallic shadow in the middle
#Person1#: which colour do you suggest?
#Person2#: you have green eyes, so maybe purple?
#Person1#: okay ^^
#Person1#: thank you:*

#Person1#: You caught me here. I'm vaguely considering going down to Onrus again, most likely in January. What does it look like with vacancies then?
#Person2#: Perfect! Just give me your dates and I'll keep it booked for you.
#Person1#: Would you prefer me to do it via airbnb website or just like this directly with you?
#Person2#: I think it'll be more advantageous for both of us to do it directly. Do you know exactly when you'll be coming?
#Person1#: Not so much. Can I get back to you in 2, 3 days' time?
#Person2#: ASAP really. As I say we've been receiving bookings daily now.
#Person1#: Well, no big deal. I'll be staying in Cape Town for a longer time and am quite flexible in my dates.

#Person1#: No. I am single again. Hurray! So pls make it single occupancy any week in January, Anton.

#Person2#: shoes?

"#Person1#: Din anyone actually watch this the video?
#Person1#: <link_video>
#Person2#: Research shows that long term cannabis use ( via smoke inhalation ) produces NO noticeable long term consequences - whereas tobacco use leads to COPD ect. But cannabis causes more inflammation of the lungs and increase symptoms such as wheeziness and shortness of breath. But these subside when cannabis smoking ceases.
#Person3#: Wrong, it wasn't long term use, but rather an ""occasional low cumulative"", which could be something like smoking once or twice a month.

#Person8#: Jason Hollis yuck...why even???
#Person4#: I know that a joint is bigger than a roach, so is a spliff bigger than a joint?
#Person7#: I don’t believe there is a size relationship between names of roll-ups (except for the roach which is a mostly smoked roll-up). I say that the names began as code words for an illegal item at that time. Some spliffs may be big some joints be small...
#Person9#: Allen So quit smoking it and no inflammation which we all know that inflammation is the number one cause of all other health issues.
#Person4#: BTW Seeing it's still illegal at a federal level, I'd like to know where such studies were conducted legally. Propaganda. Keep gobbling those opiate based pills, they're fine
