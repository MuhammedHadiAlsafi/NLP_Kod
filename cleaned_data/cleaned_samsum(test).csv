#Person1#: Just rewatching Dear White People on Netflix, love it!😍
#Person2#: Oh yeah, heard of it, but not seen it yet? Any good?
#Person1#: Well, yes! I just said it was, LOL. It's about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence.
#Person2#: Why is it called Dear White People?
#Person1#: That's the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio.
#Person2#: Yeah, but why is it so good?
#Person1#: Well, it's mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too.
#Person2#: I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then?
#Person1#: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand.
#Person2#: How's that?
#Person1#: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that.
#Person2#: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?
#Person1#: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.
#Person2#: Well, I must say, it does sound good, I'll check it out soon!
#Person1#: Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it!
#Person2#: Well, thanks Clara, I'm just watching the rest of a movie and I'll try Dear White People.

#Person2#: Me too, I suggested she should see a specialist, but she wasn't very happy about it
#Person1#: No wonder...
#Person2#: I know, but I think this is serious. She's saying she's depressed, like everyone around, but in her case it may be true
#Person1#: She was telling me she doesn't feel like doing anything, she's bored all the time, she never feels happy. It sounds like a real, typical depression
#Person1#: She also told me that she has trouble sleeping. I asked her to go out for a beer or anything basically, but she doesn't want to leave the flat
#Person2#: Oh my, it sounds really serious. I don't what to tell you
#Person1#: I was wondering how I can help her
#Person2#: Honestly I don't know if we can help her, Adam. I suggested a specialist because these are very sensitive issues and I'm afraid we may unintentionally make it worse
#Person1#: Yes, but she doesn't want to see a specialist. Basically, she doesn't want to see anyone
#Person2#: Hm... I don't know... How about I call someone for advice? So we could know what to do
#Person1#: Sounds rational, do you know anyone you could call? Don't mention her name
#Person2#: Of course I won't! I have a friend who's a psychologist, we can trust her. I'll let you know
#Person1#: Thank you Karen!",#Person1# and #Person2# are worried that May suffers from depression. #Person2# will call her friend who is a psychologist and ask for advice.

#Person1#: I just see it in her eyes...
#Person2#: any example?
#Person1#: I just feel it...
#Person1#: hard to give any example.
#Person1#: I'm his first gf and she's jelous...
#Person2#: what??? u r his first gf??
#Person2#: how old is he??? o_O???
#Person1#: 26 but he's a nerd.
#Person1#: he used to spend all the time at home..
#Person2#: so he lives at home with mummy?? LOL
#Person1#: yeah.. mummy and gramma
#Person2#: fuck, really??
#Person2#: and u think he's normal?
#Person1#: he's an introvert...
#Person1#: it's a big house..
#Person2#: but has he ever lived somewhere else?
#Person2#: u know shared flat, erasmus?
#Person1#: nope...
#Person2#: he's really weird..
#Person1#: he's just a nerd, but v.intelligent!
#Person1#: w8, he's writing sth, will text u l8er.
#Person2#: ok",#Person2# believes her boyfriend's mother dislikes her. He is a nerd who lives and has always lived with his mother and grandmother.
"#Person1#: Yeah, but u can also read the news online[WINK]
#Person2#: I know, but imagine - ur keen on technology and u get all the news in one place. Then u can choose what to read and what not.
#Person1#: Sounds sensible. Does it have something 4 fashion?
#Person2#: Probably so. Not sure, though.
#Person1#: How about u, Vic?
#Person3#: I still prefer Facebook. Had Twitter once, but the interaction with others is nothing compared with Facebook.
#Person2#: Well, it's intended in a completely different way.
#Person3#: What do u mean?
#Person2#: IMO, Twitter is not for interacting like on Facebook, but for getting news fast and from reliable, more or less, sources. U can follow anyone and anyone can follow u.
#Person3#: Still, on Facebook I can share stuff with my friends, join groups and talk about things that interest me. And I don't have to limit myself to 140 characters.
#Person2#: 280. Still, a downside. OTOH, if ppl were able to write as much as they wanted, Twitted would get as cluttered as Facebook.
#Person1#: So no one uses 4 example Instagram?
#Person3#: I do.
#Person2#: Not 4 me. I don't post that many pictures online.
#Person1#: But u can follow ppl and see what they're doing or offering. There are also companies on Instagram.
#Person2#: I know, but I'm more interested in news and gossip than seeing someone post a picture of their breakfast.
#Person3#: That's not all ppl post on Instagram!
#Person2#: So, what else?
#Person3#: Depends on ur interest. I, for one, like to observe all the fitness accounts[HAPPY]
#Person2#: And does this motivate u to train?
#Person3#: No, but it gives me hints what to do and what not.
#Person1#: What do u think about Tumblr?
#Person2#: What?
#Person3#: Heard about it, but never had an account.
#Person1#: It's a microblogging website. U can post blog entries, pictures and basically everything u want there. And ppl can observe u!
#Person2#: Don't have that much time to write a blog.
#Person3#: Me neither.
#Person2#: Nancy, y do u ask these questions?[WINK]
#Person1#: I have my reasons[WINK]","#Person1# asks #Person3# and #Person2# about various social media, which prompts them to discuss and compare the different platforms. #Person2# is not into Instagram but likes Twitter. #Person3# prefers Facebook over Twitter and likes Instagram. #Person2# and #Person3# both don't use Tumblr."

"#Person1#: I'm curious. How's the waste management working out over there?
#Person2#: It actually works very well. We use three different bins: compost, recycle and trash. Compost anything organic from yard waste to food scraps. Recycle for paper, bottles, cardboard, plastic, metals. And trash everything else. Why do you ask?
#Person1#: Sheer curiosity. What about general awareness? Plastic bags, etc.?
#Person2#: Very high. No more single use plastic bags in grocery stores. No more straws in restaurants.
#Person1#: Yeah, I read yours was one of the cities that banned them. I wonder when that will get here.
#Person2#: Never...
#Person1#:: What do you mean?
#Person2#: I highly doubt that type of environmental awareness will happen there. People there live in a different world when it comes to that.
#Person1#: People don't have to have any awareness, tbh. It's above them. If there were such decisions made they would follow
#Person2#: That is true. But at the state government level I don't think there is that awareness either. But hopefully I am proven wrong!
#Person1#: Really bizarre. I noticed it's struggling here. On the other hand, it's money.
#Person2#: Money in the sense of?
#Person1#: Reducing waste=lower utilization costs. Do they sort through everything further down?
#Person2#: Yes here they do.
#Person1#: It seems to be the same way here. Dry recyclables, food and general, compost","#Person2# uses three different bins for waste. He doesn't use straws, neither plastic bags. #Person1# and #Person2# agree that environment protection depends on the government."

#Person2#: Hello Noah, but of course I am.Thank you.
#Person1#: Actually William went to collect the rest of them for you immediately. They're in a basket on our terrace, so you call collect them any time.
#Person2#: That's very very kind of him! He's really a darling.
#Person2#: We won't be going your direction any time soon I'm afraid. How long will they keep? Is it windfall?
#Person1#: Both really but they all look very healthy. No bruises afa one can see. Or only odd small ones. They' be alright for a couple of days I guess. The weather's cool.
#Person2#: It would be a shame if they rotted. I'll talk to Frank and maybe to the twins too and go back to you asap.
#Person1#: OK.
#Person2#: Hey Noah, the twins will be on their way from Notts tomorrow afternoon and passing Windfield. Is it alright if they pop in and collect the quince?
#Person1#: Absolutely! In fact anyone can come any time and just take them from our terrace. Of course it would be great to see your twins again. Haven't seen them for ages!
#Person2#: Well we don't see that much of them either[SAD] They'll be coming home this weekend only because of Alexa's ceremony.
#Person1#: Notts is 3 hours' drive away so small wonder they don't fancy it so much.
#Person2#: I don't blame them! We're both happy they've been doing fine at college. Everything's absolutely fine. You don't have William at home all that often either, do you?
#Person1#: He gets 5 days at Xmas by way of ""family care"" and 2 weeks off spread over the whole year but never longer that 5 days. They have a strict regime at the academy. But after all these years we've learned to cope with it. What worries me is that he seems to have no time to even think about getting married and start a family of his own.
#Person2#: The fate of most military I guess. Hugely unfair I'd say. Like being married to your regiment!
#Person1#: That's what it sounds like when he talks about himself! I never hear a girl's name! And when I ask, he gets brusque.
#Person2#: Oh dear! What could it mean?
#Person1#: No, not what you think! We know from Capt. Broomsberg about their common escapades. Plenty of women but only that sort of women. No strings.
#Person2#: I never even imagined he might be gay! Surely not. But there must be sth else.
#Person1#: We think he's just so obsessively career-minded. Nothing else counts for him.
#Person2#: He's always been very strong-willed. And he knows what he wants. Well if I were you I wouldn't worry at all.
#Person1#: You're probably right. But you know I'd love it so much to have plenty of grandchildren around me.
#Person2#: They'll come, don't you worry! Look the twins will contact you about the quince. Alright?
#Person1#: Sure. Thank you Sophie for a nice chat!
#Person2#: Thank you for the quince!",#Person2# accepts some quince from #Person1#. #Person1# has left the quince in a basket on his terrace and the twins can pick it up any time. The twins are in college. #Person1#'s son is in the military. He is still single but reportedly not gay.

#Person1#: Ahahahaha
#Person1#: True, I saw that!

#Person2#: I mean it's so monotonous and hypnotic. Kind of... lulling you to sleep
#Person3#: Yeah, that guy is like David Copperfield among lecturers
#Person2#: Haha David Copperfield[LAUGH]
#Person2#: Let's call him like that from now on! He even looks like the magician a little[LAUGH]
#Person1#: That's a fancy nickname, I like it

#Person2#: Not a bit!

#Person2#: I was educated in Loughborouogh, so in a sense I came from there.
#Person1#: OK.
#Person2#: In another sense I come from my mother's vagina, but I dare say everyone can say that.
#Person1#: Are you all right?
#Person2#: IN another sense I come from the atoms in the air that I breath or the food I eat, which comes to me from many places, so all I can say is ""I come from Planet Earth"".

#Person2#: Start games before you start drinking[HAPPY] And don't bring any game that is either over-complicated, requires too much time to explain, or god forbid encourages direct conflict - you know, the plotting-scheming stuff. So no Game of Thrones[HAPPY]
#Person2#: Or alternatively you can chose some cooperative games - like Arkham Horror, Robinson Crusoe, Pandemic
#Person1#: Got it[LAUGH]
#Person2#: Also would be great to know what theme they all like - if there is one. And if not then there are some 'vanilla' games - like Codenames or Catan. Any idea what they might be into?
#Person1#: Not really - there are some guys who I know like sci-fi and comic books, but no idea about the girls...
#Person2#: The best way - just talk with them - might be surprised by their tastes and experiences. Maybe some of them are already into gaming? There are nerds in every walk of life[HAPPY]
#Person1#: Yeah, I know, all too well[HAPPY]

"#Person1#: Hello. I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.
#Person2#: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts?
#Person1#: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.
#Person2#: Why is that?
#Person1#: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.
#Person2#: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?
#Person1#: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.
#Person2#: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?
#Person1#: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.
#Person2#: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?
#Person1#: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.
#Person2#: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?
#Person1#: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.
#Person2#: So what would you recommend?
#Person1#: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night.
#Person2#: That sounds good. would that be sufficient?
#Person1#: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.
#Person2#: OK, is this something your company can help with?
#Person1#: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want.
#Person2#: Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email?
#Person1#: Of course, I will have that done by Friday.
#Person2#: That would be great. And again, thanks for today!

"#Person1#: Friendly reminder of trade deadline today. Let's get those last minute trade request sent.
#Person2#: So does John get Lamar Jackson or is he scrambling for another qb??
#Person1#: Nick needs to really think about rolling with Blake. John needs a QB!
#Person3#: I think I would have rights to Lamar but I think the consensus is that he's on waivers so he's open. I guess I'm just hoping RGIII and Brock play or just wait...
#Person2#: Crazy it happens though! he one thing in the chart that isn't addressed. We could vote and go from there. I just want you to lose a player and Nick not to get Lamar.
#Person3#: In 15 years I've never seen a ream trade a big time RB or WR for a QB this late n the season do anything in the playoffs. That ends their season. Of course a one QB team isn't worth anything either. I have t take my chances.
#Person1#: Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
#Person2#: people's evidence #658 why the QB rule doesn't work.
#Person3#: I might have a way to drop the rule completely next year.
#Person1#: I guess we will have to talk about after the season.
#Person2#: Nobody liked my IR suggestion a couple of years ago. That solves a large percentage of the issue tho
#Person1#: 1 QB not 2 for a 14 league...
#Person3#: as I said, we can look at if after the season. I just wouldn't want to make it any easier.

#Person3#: Sounds cool. I was thinking of going this weekend with Lane, but I've seen some bad reviews.
#Person1#: Depends on what you expect really - I have a lot of sentiment towards Harry Potter so, I'm gonna like everything the do. But seriously the movie was decent. However, if you're expecting to have your mind blown, then no, it's not THAT good.
#Person2#: I agree. I saw it last week and basically I'm satisfied.
#Person3#: No spoilers, girls.
#Person1#: no worries[WINK]
#Person1#: And Gina, what do you think about Eddie Redmayne as Newt?

#Person1#: So, what about Foucault's Pendulum? Do you like it?
#Person2#: It's... weird. Was it really written by an Italian guy? It's so... nerdy.
#Person1#: Oh well, in a sense Eco was the king of nerds. And, you know, not all Italian books are about pizza, mafia and mandolino.:P
#Person2#: Yes, I know... I should try and read one of his novels in the original, but I'm not sure my level of Italian is adequate.
#Person1#: The Name of the Rose is really difficult for a foreign speaker of Italian, you know.
#Person2#: And what about Foucault's Pendulum?
#Person1#: Well, it's set in the 1980s, so the language is definitely more comprehensible. The content, however, is just as complicated as in the other novel.
#Person2#: Btw, I read Salman Rushdie's review of Pendulum, published in the 80s.
#Person1#: Really? What did he say?
#Person2#: He hated it and said that it's not a novel, but rather a computer game.
#Person1#: What? Rotfl!
#Person2#: That's what Salman said...
#Person1#: Oh well, de gustipus non est disputandum...
#Person2#: De gustiBus!

#Person2#: What? Are u sure?
#Person1#: No, I'm not, but in the commercial they mentioned a name of an illness I have never heard of.
#Person2#: So what? There are many illnesses and diseases I've never heard of.
#Person1#: So I did some research. Turns out such a thing does not exist. No medical journal writes about it, no medical forum suggests caution.
#Person2#: That doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
#Person1#: I even found a youtube video of a doctor explaining y it's not an illness.
#Person2#: All right, this is quite serious.
#Person1#: So I put my mind to it and do u know what I came up with?
#Person2#: What?
#Person1#: That in this particular case they're selling mints as medical products!
#Person2#: Srsly?!
#Person1#: Absolutely!
#Person2#: How long do u think they've been lying to us?
#Person1#: Can't be sure, but probably 4ever. Imagine every illness, disease and so on. Where do these come from? Why do they spread so fast?
#Person2#: That is kinda puzzling.
#Person1#: Right?
#Person2#: So why is no one doing anything about it?

#Person2#: No.
